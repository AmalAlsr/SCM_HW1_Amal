## 📌 Why Configuration Management Matters

Configuration management (CM) plays a vital role in software development.  
It allows teams to:

- Track and control changes to code and documentation.
- Manage different versions of a project reliably.
- Collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other's work.
- Maintain consistency across development, testing, and deployment environments.

By using tools like Git, developers can ensure traceability, accountability, and stability throughout the project lifecycle.
